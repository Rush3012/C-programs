Subject: Appeal for Assistance in Procuring Supply in [Specific Subject] Examination only

Dear Controller of Examinations,
  I ,NAKASH BIN NOUSHIK , 3rd year civil engineering student of CET Tvm , writing this letter to convey my deepest concern about the action that i have done during my last semester examination . I understand the seriousness of academic misconduct But i was unaware of the revised circular that debars from all the registered courses in that examination.In the light of this situation , I am not seeking for the exoneration for my actions. Instead I kindly request you to realise my regret and address the consequences specifically only in the [subject with code] for which i have been caught by the faculty instead of debaring from all my registered courses.

I am ensuring that such behavior does not repeat in the future.And I am really sorry for what i have done unintentionally.
I understand that the consequences of my actions are serious. However, I sincerely hope you consider my plea for assistance in the context of my genuine desire to rectify my mistake and continue my education with a renewed sense of responsibility.

Thank you for considering my appeal. I am available for any further discussions or clarifications you may require. I appreciate your understanding and hope for a fair and just resolution to this matter.

Sincerely,
